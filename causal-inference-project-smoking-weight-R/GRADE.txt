Very good analysis. I appreciate all the different approaches taken, including the
G-methods and doubly-robust estimators that we have not seen in class. The
discussion summarizes very well all the methodologies employed and their
results, but it lacks a reflection on how would you improve the study, or if
it could be improved at all.

GRADE: 9.5
